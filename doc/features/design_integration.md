# Design Integration

This covers some of the remaining design issues that we need to resolve before the beta/final 4.0 release.

## [Ask Kyle]

* Fonts for Dashboard table headers/menus are just less bold than in design.
* Icons for:
    - Edit button (Pencil) for content
    - Links
    - Portlets - Should use 'list' icon
    - Other Content Types (Product, Catalog, Generic Document) - Ideas: Book? Newspaper? Full page?
    - Visual Indicator for a section/page can't be edited. (Currently just removing the buttons)
    - Up and down sorting icons (caret is always down)
* Need style for Checkbox groups that are labeled. See Add User.
* Tables that are too wide (/cms/routes)
* JQuery Date picker - Has no styling.
* Styling for CKEditor 'selector'.
* Need help styling 'path' element.
* Errors - Review the placement of errors on the form.
* Products
    - Photo 2 is wrapping unnecessarily (Does it without photo 1)
    - Slug path needs styling.

## IA Questions

* What Label for first element under Assets? (Assets? Asset library). Or just make Text first.
* Selecting a section always toggles. Might want to select an open section to add content to it, but not close it.
* Where should "Settings" link take user to.
